You can learn more about the Services and how they work at [https://docs.thorswap.finance/].

THORSwap shall have the right at any time to change or discontinue any aspect or feature of the THORSwap Service, including, but not limited to, content, access, or use. THORSwap reserves the right to terminate your access to the THORSwap Services at any time, without notice, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation a violation of these Terms, and you agree that THORSwap will not be liable to you or any third party for any such termination, suspension, or modification of your access to the THORSwap Services.

THORSwap may charge a fee with respect to certain transactions submitted using the Site or Services. The fee, if any, for a transaction is displayed on the Site prior to entering into the transaction. Any such fees are denominated in the destination token, and are automatically included in your transaction bundle when using the Services.

# **THORSwap's Role**

Nothing contained in the THORSwap Services or any other content on the Site constitutes a solicitation, recommendation, endorsement, or offer by THORSwap to buy or sell any securities or other financial instruments.

THORSwap is not acting as your financial, legal, or tax advisor and you must not regard us as acting in that capacity. You should consult your own independent professional advisors before entering into any transaction and enter into a transaction only if you fully understand its nature, the contractual relationship into which you are entering, all relevant terms and conditions, and the nature and extent of your exposure to loss.

Given the nature of blockchain-based Digital Assets and the associated risks of Digital Assets, THORSwap is unable to guarantee that any Services will function or otherwise be accessible via the Site as intended or that all THORSwap Services will operate as intended. Accordingly, THORSwap cannot be held liable if Digital Assets or THORSwap Services cease to function, or never function, as intended due to errors that may occur on the underlying blockchain that the Digital Assets or THORSwap Services depend upon, or errors with storage solutions for the Digital Assets or other THORSwap Services. In particular, THORSwap cannot be held liable for errors related to decentralized storage solutions that may be employed by Users, THORSwap, and other third-party affiliates that may occur and result in the inability to access Digital Assets or THORSwap Services or may otherwise impair the foregoing.

THORSwap is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, financial institution, or money services business. We do not have custody or control over any Digital Assets or blockchains you are interacting with and we do not execute purchases, transfers, or sales of Digital Assets or validations of Digital Asset transactions. To use THORSwap Services, you must use a third-party wallet which allows you to engage in transactions on blockchains.

Please note that THORSwap bears no responsibility for the functionality or integrity of any underlying blockchain, decentralized storage solution, or distributed ledger network associated with any Digital Assets relating to the THORSwap Services. Similarly, THORSwap cannot guarantee the functionality of any THORSwap Services that are impacted by third parties that THORSwap may work with or which THORSwap or the Services may depend upon.

**THORSwap is not an affiliate of THORChain or any associated entities.**

As used in these Terms, "Digital Assets" means assets or items that are created or maintained on distributed ledger systems, including (a) assets that are created, maintained and utilized on a specific distributed ledger system or smart contract and are an integral feature of the distributed ledger system or smart contract, (b) digital representations of other types of assets created and maintained on a distributed ledger system, (c) equity or digital assets of or issued by companies operating in the crypto industry, and (d) other crypto-finance and digital assets, or instruments for the purchase of such, each often referred to, variously, as cryptoassets, cryptocurrencies, virtual assets, virtual currencies, digital assets, convertible virtual currencies, whether issued in a private or public transaction including, without limitation, RUNE, the native token of the THORChain Network.

# **Copyright Infringement Complaints Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act**

THORSwap respects the intellectual property rights of others. It is our policy to respond promptly to any claim that content posted on the Site infringes the copyright or other intellectual property rights of any person. THORSwap will use reasonable efforts to investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate action under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") and these Terms, including removing or disabling access to content claimed to be infringing and/or terminating accounts and access to the Site.

# The DMCA Process and Procedure

The DMCA provides a process for a copyright owner to give notification to an online provider concerning alleged copyright infringement. When an effective DMCA Take-Down Notice is received, the online provider responds under this process by taking down the offending content. On taking down content under the DMCA, we will take reasonable steps to contact the party responsible for minting the removed content so that a Counter Notification may be filed if applicable. On receiving a valid Counter Notification, we generally restore the content in question, unless we receive notice from the DMCA notice provider that a legal action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in the infringing activity. If you have any questions about your rights, copyright infringement, or the notification and counter-notification process under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, we recommend that you speak with an attorney.

# Filing a DMCA "Take Down" Notification

If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any Content on the Site infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by providing us with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C. § 512 for further detail):

- A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
- Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works, a representative list of such works at that site.
- Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material. Providing URLs in the body of your DMCA notification is the best way to help us locate content quickly
- Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you (the complaining party), such as an address, telephone number, and electronic mail address at which you (the complaining party) may be contacted.
- A statement that you (the complaining party) have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
- A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you (the complaining party) are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
- (Optional) Provide information, if possible, sufficient to permit us to notify the user(s) who posted the content that allegedly contains infringing material.

Any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that information or activity on the Site is infringing or that any material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable to us and possibly others for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees incurred by us in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing or in replacing the removed material or enabling access to it.

# Responding to a DMCA Notice with a Counter-Notification

We will take reasonable steps to promptly inform you if your content has been taken down upon receipt of an effective DMCA Infringement Take-Down Notice. If you believe that the content that was removed or to which access was disabled is not infringing, or that you have authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to mint and use the material, you may send us a Counter Notification containing the following information:

- Your physical or electronic signature;
- Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;
- A statement that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or a misidentification of the material; and
- Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the U.S. district court in the state in which you reside (or the U.S. district court where our headquarters are located if your address is outside of the United States), and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement to us.

You have ten (10) business days after receipt of a DMCA take-down Notice to send us an effective Counter Notification or the allegedly infringing material may not be restored.

Any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing or that any material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable to us for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees incurred by us in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing or in replacing the removed material or enabling access to it.

# Where to Send a DMCA Request

You must submit your DMCA Take-Down Notice and Counter Notifications to us by email at the following email address: [support@THORSwap.finance](mailto:support@ThorSwap.finance) with the following subject/heading for the email: "THORSwap DMCA Take Down Notice."

WHILE THORSWAP ATTEMPTS TO MAKE YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE SAFE, THORSWAP CANNOT AND DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SITE, SERVICES, OR OUR SITE PROVIDERS' SERVERS ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF ANY DATA THAT YOU DISCLOSE ONLINE. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR OBTAINED FROM THE THORSWAP PARTIES OR THROUGH THE SITE, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN. YOU ACCEPT THE INHERENT SECURITY RISKS OF PROVIDING INFORMATION AND DEALING ONLINE OVER THE INTERNET AND WILL NOT HOLD THORSWAP RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY.

WE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS AND TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR, ANY USE OR MISUSE OF THE THORSWAP SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES, OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM: (A) USER ERROR, INCORRECTLY CONSTRUCTED TRANSACTIONS, OR MISTYPED ADDRESSES; (B) SERVER FAILURE OR DATA LOSS; (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE; (D) ANY UNAUTHORIZED THIRD-PARTY ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE USE OF VIRUSES, PHISHING, BRUTEFORCING OR OTHER MEANS OF ATTACK AGAINST THE SITE OR DIGITAL ASSETS.

DIGITAL ASSETS EXIST ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE ASSOCIATED BLOCKCHAIN (E.G., ETHEREUM NETWORK). ANY TRANSFERS OR SALES OCCUR ON THE ASSOCIATED BLOCKCHAIN (E.G., ETHEREUM). THORSWAP AND/OR ANY OTHER THORSWAP PARTY CANNOT GUARANTEE, EFFECT OR OTHERWISE CONTROL THE TRANSFER OF TITLE OR RIGHT IN ANY DIGITAL ASSET OR UNDERLYING OR ASSOCIATED CONTENT OR ITEMS.

THORSWAP DOES NOT MAKE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE VALUE OR FITNESS OF ANY PARTICULAR DIGITAL ASSETS(S), OR ANY THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES OR OTHER THORSWAP SERVICES THAT A USER MAY INTERACT WITH ON THE SITE OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE SERVICES.

NO THORSWAP PARTY IS RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY SUSTAINED LOSSES OR INJURY DUE TO VULNERABILITY OR ANY KIND OF FAILURE, ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR OF SOFTWARE (E.G., WALLET, SMART CONTRACT), BLOCKCHAINS OR ANY OTHER FEATURES OF THE SERVICES. NO THORSWAP PARTY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSSES OR INJURY DUE TO LATE REPORTS BY DEVELOPERS OR REPRESENTATIVES (OR NO REPORT AT ALL) OF ANY ISSUES WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN SUPPORTING THE SERVICES, INCLUDING FORKS, TECHNICAL NODE ISSUES OR ANY OTHER ISSUES HAVING LOSSES OR INJURY AS A RESULT.

ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE THORSWAP SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER OR OTHER ELECTRONIC SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH OR FROM THE THORSWAP SERVICE, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THORSWAP IS NOT LIABLE FOR THE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS, AND THAT YOU ALONE ARE ASSUMING THE RISK OF INJURY FROM THE FOREGOING, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. THORSWAP PROVIDES NO GUARANTEE AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF DELETION, MIS-DELIVERY OR FAILURE TO STORE COMMUNICATIONS, PERSONALIZED SETTINGS, OR OTHER DATA.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties in contracts with consumers, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.

# **Limitation of Liability**

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THORSWAP BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFIT OR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM THESE TERMS, THE SITE, PRODUCTS OR THIRD PARTY SITES AND PRODUCTS, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATED TO LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE AND EVEN IF THORSWAP OR ITS AGENTS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE SITES, SERVICES OR THIRD-PARTY SITES AND PRODUCTS ARE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING THEREFROM.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, IN NO EVENT (I) SHALL THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THORSWAP ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) $100 OR (B) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO THORSWAP FOR THE SERVICES IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS OUT OF WHICH LIABILITY AROSE OR (II) SHALL THORSWAP OR ITS AGENTS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY TORT, CONTRACT OR ANY OTHER LIABILITY ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE THORSWAP SERVICES, OR RELIANCE ON ANY INFORMATION OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY THORSWAP. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE LIABILITY OF THORSWAP FOR (A) DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY THORSWAP GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR RECKLESSNESS; OR FOR (B) ANY INJURY CAUSED BY A MEMBER OF THORSWAP'S FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION.

Because some jurisdictions prohibit the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such jurisdictions the limitation of liability only with respect to consequential or incidental damages may not apply to you, and the respective liability of THORSwap and its agents, employees, distributors and agents is limited to the greatest extent allowable under applicable law in those states.

# **Assumption of Risk**

You accept and acknowledge:

- THORSwap does not provide legal, tax, regulatory, financial, accounting or other advice.
- The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based items is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of THORSwap Services and the utility of Digital Assets.
- Prices of Digital Assets and the validation of Digital Assets are subject to volatility and fluctuations.THORSwap shall have no liability for fluctuations in the value of any cryptocurrency, transaction, or any bundle of transactions, whether requested or provided.
- You acknowledge that the markets for Digital Assets are highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems are variable and may increase dramatically at any time.
- You acknowledge that THORSwap is constantly improving its security measures against security breaches that might result in the loss of data. In such a case, THORSwap and its third-party partners responsible for the operation of the Site, Service or software shall not be liable to users for any damage caused.
- You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions and to withhold, collect, report, and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. THORSwap is not responsible for determining, withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting the taxes that apply to your Digital Assets.
- You represent and warrant that you have done sufficient research before making any decisions to utilize the Services.
- We do not control the public blockchains that you are interacting with and we do not control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to your ability to complete transactions on these public blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions are irreversible and THORSwap has no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain.
- Your participation in the Service involves the use of sophisticated hardware and/or software. THORSwap will not be liable or responsible to you, nor be deemed to have defaulted or breached these Terms, for any failure or delay in our performance under these Terms when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts or circumstances beyond our reasonable control and/or from the hardware used in the Service, including, without limitation, acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, governmental actions, war, invasion or hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot or other civil unrest, national emergency, revolution, insurrection, epidemic, pandemic, lockouts, strikes or other labor disputes (whether or not relating to our workforce), or restraints or delays affecting carriers or inability or delay in obtaining supplies of adequate or suitable materials, materials or telecommunication breakdown, or power outage.
- There are risks associated with using Internet and blockchain-based products, including, but not limited to, the risk associated with hardware, software, and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to your third-party wallet or Account. You accept and acknowledge that THORSwap will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the THORSwap Services or any blockchain network, however caused.
- The Site relies on third-party platforms, service providers and/or vendors. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers and/or vendors; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers and/or vendors change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms and/or vendors; or if any of such platforms and/or vendors loses market share, suffers technological or functionality issues, or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the THORSwap Services is likely to suffer.
- You acknowledge that the Services involve novel technological innovations aimed at facilitating more efficient access to blockchains. Results depend on a multiplicity of factors. Therefore, the outcomes cannot be predicted, and no representations or warranties are made with respect to the Services. OUTCOMES ARE NOT GUARANTEED.

- If you have a dispute with one or more users, YOU RELEASE US FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES. IN ENTERING INTO THIS RELEASE YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY PROTECTIONS (WHETHER STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) THAT WOULD OTHERWISE LIMIT THE COVERAGE OF THIS RELEASE TO INCLUDE THOSE CLAIMS WHICH YOU MAY KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN YOUR FAVOR AT THE TIME OF AGREEING TO THIS RELEASE.
- By accepting these Terms and using the Site or Services, you represent that you have the technical and financial knowledge, experience, and wherewithal to understand and undertake these risks.

# **No Investment Opportunity**

NOTHING INCLUDED ON THE SITE CONSTITUTES AN OFFER OR SOLICITATION TO SELL OR DISTRIBUTE SECURITIES OR INVESTMENTS AND RELATED SERVICES TO ANYONE IN ANY JURISDICTION.

THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT CONCERNING DIGITAL ASSETS AND BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP. THE APPLICATION AND INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE OFTEN LARGELY UNTESTED AND THERE IS A LACK OF CERTAINTY AS TO HOW THEY WILL BE APPLIED. NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL BE PROMULGATED IN THE FUTURE THAT APPLY TO BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AND DIGITAL ASSETS, AND RELATED SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT ANY SUCH CHANGES WILL NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT DIGITAL ASSETS GENERALLY, NFTS, OR CLUBS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW SUCH CHANGES WOULD AFFECT THE PRICE AND LIQUIDITY OF DIGITAL ASSETS. WE MAY HAVE TO LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN SERVICES OR DISALLOW USERS BASED ON THEIR CITIZENSHIP, RESIDENCE OR LOCATION FROM ENGAGING IN THE SERVICES OR ACCESSING THE SITE IF DOING SO BECOMES COMMERCIALLY UNSUSTAINABLE OR LEGALLY PROHIBITED.

# **Governing Law and Venue**

These Terms and your access to and use of the Site shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Singapore (without regard to conflict of law rules or principles of Singapore, or any other jurisdiction that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction).

# **Severability**

If any term, clause, or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause, or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause, or provision, or any other term, clause, or provision of these Terms.

# **Injunctive Relief**

You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to THORSwap for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and THORSwap shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security, or proof of damages.

# **California Residents**

If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code § 1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.

# **Survival**

All sections which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding any termination of these Terms by THORSwap or you. Termination will not limit any of THORSwap's other rights or remedies at law or in equity.

# **Miscellaneous**

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and THORSwap relating to your access to and use of the Site and the THORSwap Services. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of THORSwap, and THORSwap's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for reference only and shall not be read to have any legal effect.

You and THORSwap agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the interpretation or construction of these Terms.
